Live demo can be viewed here: https://edwardpkelly.github.io/lotto-number-generator/

A small React demo project that will generate random 'quick-pick' numbers for various popular Lottery games. With some basic configuration you can choose from a (3) three number daily game to (4) four balls to a (5) ball game with mega ball.

# New Features!

  - Configurable to match any game type - including mega/extra ball games
  - Animated number selection using CSS transitions and keyframes

You can also:
  - Write custom styles for the mega/extra ball
  - Configure whether numbers may repeat in the game board
  - Configure if balls should display a leading '0' (zero) for single digits
